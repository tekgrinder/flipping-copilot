process_items.py can be used to make filter lists from https://prices.runescape.wiki/osrs

Start by filtering items as you see fit on the price.runescape website. Set the
interface to show 250 items per page. Save the webpage (ctrl+s) and navigate
to that directory. There should be a subfolder container the icons of all the
items from the page you downloaded and therefore your filtered list.

Change the name of the folder with the icons to `items` and run process_items.py
in the parent directory. Make sure `complete list.csv` is in the same folder as the
python script. This should make a csv with all the items you want as a whitelist.

The whitelist is made by comparing the list of icons to `complete list.csv`. If there
are mismatches it will tell you and make a second file containing the mismatches

This method is using icons from the website is kind of jank. If somebody has a
better idea I'd appreaciate that. Maybe something with the prices api. idk.
