## THIS IS A JANKY FORK
This fork is a mod of the Flipping Copilot OSRS client plugin. I made this fork because there were features I wanted and because I wanted a project for testing LLM coding capabilities. All changes to this project were made using Anthropic Claude-Sonnet 3.5 along with [Open Hands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands). I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING. I WILL NOT HELP YOU. I WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT FIX ANY BUGS YOU ENCOUNTER. Discord: .tekis RSN: buttpee

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THIS VERSION OF THE CLIENT IS NOT ENDORSED BY THE COPILOT DEVS. DO NOT ASK THE DEVS OF THE FLIPPING COPILOT PLUGIN FOR HELP IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THIS FORK.
